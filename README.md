# Learning about CODEOWNERS files

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Use CODEOWNERS files to auto-assign code reviewers based on which files/folders were changed.

This repo has [an example PR](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-codeowners/pull/2) where [@hchiam](https://github.com/hchiam) was automatically assigned to review, because the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-codeowners/blob/master/CODEOWNERS) file had `* @hchiam`.
